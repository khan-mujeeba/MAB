After restarting the tomcat service in the MASG-1NMHLINKSAPP1 server, application is working fine.
Got the user confirmation too.

Infra Midrange team has assisted by restarting the tomcat service in the MASG-1NMHLINKSAPP1 server as requested by us.
Now the FSIS application is accessible and working fine.

CHG0023908 - FSIS 
SRAS to TATS NG service queue  QR.SRAS.MBRK.IN.02  is active from FSIS but the service is not active from EAI side. We need to detach the queue from FSIS application because the queue is not reachable to FSIS thus resulting in more errors on the application logs which is resulting out of memory.
