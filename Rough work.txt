Sir for SCV apps, I have validated SCV Service and its working fine but we are not registered in RTMM application so we are not able to access it further for the validation...
But the login page is visible for rtmm....And the UAT db is not getting connected so we are not able to add ourselves into it...
so can I drop the mail confirming that its working fine because we are able to see the deploymanager window and even access the applications
