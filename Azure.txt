----------Azure AD----------------
Azure Active Directory is Microsoftâ€™s multi-tenant, cloud-based directory and identity management service. 
multi-tenant service that provides enterprise level identity and access mngmnt for the cloud.
For an organization, Azure AD helps employees sign up to multiple services and access them anywhere over the cloud 
with a single set of login credentials.

In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), authentication involves more than just the verification of a username and password. To improve security and reduce the need for help desk assistance, Azure AD authentication includes the following components:

- Self-service password reset
- Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication
- Hybrid integration to write password changes back to on-premises environment
- Hybrid integration to enforce password protection policies for an on-premises environment
- Passwordless authentication
